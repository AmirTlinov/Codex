Codex CLI is the flagship Rust implementation of OpenAI's Codex command-line interface. The workspace provides binaries for the multi-modal CLI, TUI, exec runner, file search, and supporting services (sandboxing, backend clients, MCP tooling) so that agents can run autonomously on user tasks. The `core` crate hosts most business logic, while surrounding crates (cli, tui, exec, etc.) build various products on top of it.
