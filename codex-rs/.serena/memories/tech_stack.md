- Rust 1.80+ (workspace with many crates prefixed by `codex-`).
- Cargo workspaces with `just` recipes for fmt/fix/test. Some crates use Ratatui for TUI, tokio async runtime, serde, and MCP helpers.
- Snapshot testing via `insta` (especially in tui) and `cargo nextest` for general tests.
- Auxiliary tooling: `just`, `rg`, `cargo-insta`, `cargo-nextest`, `cargo clippy`, sandbox helpers.
- Project emphasizes DDD, Ports & Adapters, Modular Monolith design.
