- Additional tooling directories: `scripts/`, `.agents/` for automation, `docs/` for user-facing docs, `mcp-server/` for MCP server implementation, `protocol-ts/` for TS bindings, etc.
- Each crate is named with `codex-` prefix per directory.
- Configuration and repo-level tools defined in `justfile`, `config.md`, `docs/`.
