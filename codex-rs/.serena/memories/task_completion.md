After making Rust changes, always run `just fmt` automatically. Before finalizing, run `just fix -p <crate>` to catch lint issues (ask user only before running workspace-wide `just fix`). Run targeted tests for touched crates (`cargo test -p <crate>` or `cargo nextest ...`). If `core`, `common`, or `protocol` change, also run `cargo test --all-features` after user approval. Update docs in `docs/` when an API changes. Keep working tree clean; make Conventional Commits after each significant step, running tests/linters before each commit. Never rely on mocks/fakes/stubs in production. Snapshots via `cargo insta` must be reviewed/accepted when UI output changes.
